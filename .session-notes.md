## Session Log

### Session: 2025-12-26 (Evening)
**Accomplishments:**
- Fixed hero.png banners not showing on project cards (changed image paths in projects.ts)
- Fixed hero banners showing broken image icons (implemented base64 encoding for screenshots)
- Fixed mobile app hero banners showing misaligned/nested phone frames
- Updated generate-banners.mjs to handle mobile apps differently (use existing mockups directly)
- Reduced featured projects from 9 to 6 on homepage (removed ReportGen, itsjesse-mobile, SmartClassify)
- Added object-left CSS to ProjectCard for better banner cropping

**Commits Made:**
- itsjesse.dev: "Session end: Hero banners, mobile app fixes, featured projects cleanup"

**Files Changed:**
- site/scripts/generate-banners.mjs - Added base64 image loading, mobile app handling
- site/src/data/projects.ts - Changed images to hero.png, updated featured flags
- site/src/components/ProjectCard.tsx - Added object-left for image positioning
- site/public/projects/*/hero.png - Generated 15 new hero banners

**Notes:**
- Cloudflare cache can be stubborn - hard refresh may be needed after deployments
- Mobile app screenshots are already complete mockups, so banner script uses them directly
