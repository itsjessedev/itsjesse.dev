# DevScout Session Notes

## Session: 2025-12-27 (continued)

### Accomplishments
- Fixed Replies tab persistence (localStorage for respondedPosts, postRepliesData, dismissedReplies)
- Added Dismiss button for replies (clears notification without responding)
- Tested auto-mark with CORS proxies - working correctly
- Refocused Prospects tab from 100+ broad searches to 25 targeted hiring-focused searches
- Added Hacker News "Who is hiring?" thread as prospect source
- Added Hacker News "Freelancer? Seeking freelancer?" thread as prospect source
- Added source-aware UI: "HN" badge (orange) for Hacker News posts, "r/{subreddit}" for Reddit
- Updated meta display for HN posts (no comments/upvotes shown)
- "View Post" button works for all sources (not "Reply on Reddit" for HN)

### Commits Made
- "Prospects: Add Hacker News sources, refocus on actual hiring posts"

### Technical Details
- HN posts fetched via hn.algolia.com API (no CORS issues)
- Prospects now include `source` field: 'reddit' or 'hackernews'
- HN posts scored based on keywords: remote (+15), contract/freelance (+20), tech skills (+3 each)
- Only "Seeking freelancer" posts included from HN Freelancer thread (not freelancers offering)

### Known Issues
- HN post timestamps showing incorrect dates ("20429d ago") - minor display bug
- Reddit searches in Prospects failing due to CORS (need to add proxy like Replies tab)

### Previous Session Accomplishments
- Combined Copy + Reply on Reddit into single button (Replies + Posts tabs)
- Added Reddit orange (#ff4500) and Snoo icon to Reply buttons
- Added 60s periodic auto-mark responded on Posts tab
- Added auto-cleanup for stale posts (48hr no comments -> skipped)
- Added Dev.to and Hashnode to News tab (now 4 sources)
- Replaced "Copy for Claude" with Gemini generation on News tab
- Updated Engage templates to expert-level content (removed novice)
- Fixed Gemini response variety (10 random opening styles)
- Added button colors (purple Regenerate, gray Skip) with hover animations
- Reply on Reddit now scrolls to comments (#comments anchor)
- Fixed CORS issue with auto-mark by using fallback proxies

### Next Steps
1. Fix Reddit searches in Prospects to use CORS proxy
2. Fix HN timestamp display issue
3. Consider adding more non-Reddit sources (IndieHackers, job boards)
