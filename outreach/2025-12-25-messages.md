## 1. spreadsheet hell (u/ontheedgeofacliff)

**URL:** https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ptq0n3/spreadsheet_hell/

**Context:** 90 min/week exporting CSVs from Salesforce + Jira to update master sheet

### Public Reply:

```
That weekly CSV dance sounds painful - I've helped a few people escape this exact Salesforce + Jira situation.

Quick reality check on the suggestions here: Zapier/Make work, but you'll pay $30-50/mo forever and they struggle when data needs any real transformation (merging fields, handling edge cases, custom formatting).

If your data has quirks - and it always does - a one-time Python script that runs on a schedule is often simpler and cheaper long-term. Pulls from both APIs, transforms however you need, updates your sheet automatically.

Happy to explain more if useful. Either way, hope you escape the spreadsheet hell soon.

### Follow-up DM (send after they reply positively):

```
Hey - saw you replied to my comment on the spreadsheet post.

If you want, I can take a quick look at what you're dealing with. Sometimes it's a 2-hour fix, sometimes it's more involved - but I can at least tell you what you're looking at.

No pressure either way. Just figured I'd offer since I've done this exact Salesforce+Jira thing before.

## 2. Where to hire / find app developers (u/Puzzleheaded-Wear381)

**URL:** https://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ptcjsk/where_to_hire_find_app_developers/

**Context:** Non-technical founder with app idea, worried about finding "the right person"

### Public Reply:

```
As someone who does contract dev work, here's what I'd suggest:

Before hiring anyone, get clarity on scope. The #1 reason dev projects fail isn't bad developers - it's unclear requirements. Write out exactly what the app does, screen by screen if possible. Even rough sketches help.

For finding devs: Upwork is fine for smaller projects if you filter carefully (look for 95%+ job success, read reviews). For anything serious, referrals from other founders beat platforms.

Red flags to watch for:
- Won't give rough estimates without charging
- Promises unrealistic timelines
- Can't explain trade-offs in plain English

Happy to answer questions if you want to sanity-check your approach before diving in.
```

### Follow-up DM (if they engage):

```
Hey - saw your post about finding a developer.

If you want a second opinion on your app idea before you start hiring, I'm happy to take a look. Sometimes a quick conversation saves weeks of going down the wrong path.

No sales pitch - just figured I'd offer since I've seen a lot of non-technical founders get burned by bad first hires.

## 3. Non-tech founder SaaS (u/Emotional-Ladder-860)

**URL:** https://reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1psutzu/is_a_solo_nontech_founder_enough_for_saas_with/

**Context:** Wondering if they can build SaaS solo with AI/vibe coding

### Public Reply:

```
Honest take: AI tools have gotten good enough that you can probably build an MVP yourself if it's straightforward CRUD (forms, dashboards, basic workflows).

Where it gets tricky:
- Anything involving payments, auth, or sensitive data - you want someone who knows the security gotchas
- Scaling past your first 100 users
- Integrations with other services (APIs are fiddly)

My suggestion: try building the core yourself with Cursor/Replit/whatever. You'll learn a ton and figure out what you actually need. When you hit a wall, that's when bringing in dev help makes sense - and you'll be a way better client because you understand your own product.

The worst outcome is paying someone $20k to build something you could've validated for $500.

## 4. Best dashboard for automated metrics (u/Sea-North7215)

**URL:** https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1pufs6p/best_dashboard_for_automated_metrics/

**Context:** Pulling from 3 portals, exporting CSVs, manually updating master sheet

### Public Reply:

```
The "data-entry robot" life is brutal. Been there.

For 3 portals → single view, your options depend on what those portals are:

1. **If they have APIs:** A script that pulls everything into Google Sheets or a simple dashboard (Retool, Metabase) is the cleanest solution. One-time setup, runs automatically.

2. **If no APIs:** You're stuck with either Zapier/Make ($$$/month, breaks often) or a custom scraper.

3. **Quick win:** Some portals have CSV export URLs you can automate even without a full API.

What are the 3 portals? Might be able to point you in the right direction.

## 5. [Hiring] Remote Personal Support (u/melstrip)

**URL:** https://reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1puwa1p/hiring_remote_work_us_only_personal_support/

**Context:** Software developer hiring for simple tasks on personal project

### DM (direct - it's a [Hiring] post):

```
Hi - saw your post about remote support work.

I'm a developer myself, so I can handle both the simple tasks and jump into anything technical if needed. Based in the US, reliable availability.

Happy to chat about the details if you're still looking. What's the best way to connect?
```

## Template: Generic Automation Problem

Use when you find similar posts:

```
[Acknowledge their specific pain point]

Quick thought: tools like Zapier work, but you pay monthly forever and they break when data gets weird. If your situation has any quirks (and it always does), a one-time custom script is often simpler and cheaper.

Happy to explain more if useful - I do this kind of automation work. Either way, hope you find a solution soon.
