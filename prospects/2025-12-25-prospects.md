## OUTREACH TEMPLATES

### For Spreadsheet/Automation Problems:
```
That weekly CSV dance sounds painful - I've seen this exact Salesforce + Jira situation before.

Quick thought: tools like Zapier work, but you'll pay monthly forever and they struggle with complex data transformations. If your data has any quirks (formatting, merging logic, etc.), a one-time custom script might actually be simpler and cheaper long-term.

Happy to explain more if useful - I do this kind of automation work. Either way, hope you escape spreadsheet hell soon!
